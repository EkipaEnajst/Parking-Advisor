# Parking Advisor
This repo contains the code for the 'Parking advisor' microservice, which is in charge of suggesting parking spaces when browsing the application and ordering them to user specified parameters.

### Setup
If you're a user that wants to experience this app, you don't have to lift a finger, as the app is available [here](http://34.154.95.135:4200/).
However if you're a dev who wants to work on this app, simply rebase the main branch of the repo onto your own branch, import the project into IntelliJ IDEA and begin working.
